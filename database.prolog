scene_text(fullers_electrical_repair, "Several blocks north of Fulton, the main business street of downtown Brooklyn, Fuller's Electrical Repair occupies a two-story brick warehouse. Whether visiting Fuller or Fitzpatrick first, when Viv approaches Fuller's, she sees a small crowd of men waiting outside. Even in the city, work for electricians comes in piecemeal and more infrequently as the Depression worsens. A job with Fuller's guarantees a steady meal ticket. Once word got out that one of Fuller's employees has gone AWOL, several dozen men began lingering outside the shop in hopes of catching the big man's attention when he steps outside. If Viv stops to listen to the men talk, she learns that, the last few days, Fuller has asked one or two men to show him their skills. He must have high standards, however, as those men haven't come back.").
scene_text(fullers_electrical_repair, "Apart from a tidy desk in the front, the inside of Fuller's reflects its warehouse origins. A small mezzanine office, accessible by iron staircase and walkway, sits on top of a storage room at the back. On the high-ceilinged main floor, a dozen men work at individual benches over an assortment of smaller items (radios, sewing machines, irons) and a few large appliances (refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines). Most don't look up, but one or two glance her way. If Viv asks about Charlie Fitzpatrick immediately, a nearby worker indicates a shorter, broad-shouldered figure in a cap working near the back of the room. Otherwise, Mr. Fuller's secretary, Petunia Adams, comes bustling forward to meet her. A well-scrubbed young woman of about 25 in a sensible cotton print frock, Petunia maintains an immaculate bun and an all-business attitude 'to keep the boys at bay.' She considers herself a kind of 'den mother' to the 'boys' in the shop, even those a decade older than herself.").

Stella has attended several of Madame Isis' 'communions' with the dead. While Madame Isis always starts by reading from the Book of the Dead, the communion soon devolves into a fairly ordinary séance with Egyptian trappings. Stella gives Viv directions to 'what used to be a café' in an artistic neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Either when talking to Stella or drawing on a memory of Esteban Manuel Aragon Gonzalez giving a lecture on archaeology, Viv recalls the famous story of Isis, Osiris, and Set. The goddess Nephthys, while Set's sister-consort, assisted her sister Isis in retrieving the fourteen missing pieces of her brother Osiris. Some paintings depict her as a hawk, flying above the Nile on the hunt for parts of Osiris' body.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "The Temple of Nephthys sits among small businesses and neat apartment buildings in a much better area of Brooklyn than George's apartment building. From the street, it looks like one of the storefront churches popping up in black communities throughout the city. Stenciled letters spell out its name over the door, and decorative ankhs and cartouches on its whitewashed façade ensure even casual passers-by don't mistake it for an ordinary church. Heavy curtains block any view of the interior, although one can see the word Café in light relief despite someone's best attempts to scrape it off the windows.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "If Viv arrives during the day, the temple is locked, although Madame Isis can still be found inside. When she knocks, Madame Isis herself opens it. If the player instead chooses to use Locksmith to open it, it requires a Difficulty 5 Stealth test to do so in broad daylight. On failure, Madame Isis hears her fumbling in the lock and jerks the door open, starting the interaction on a hostile footing.").

scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "In a film, Madame Isis Neferi (née Bertha Cook) might be played by an aging Louise Fletcher. Rather than spend her hard-grifted money on the exotic robes and turbans favored by some mediums, she cultivates a simple aesthetic of black dresses accented by a heavy silver ankh necklace. When imparting wisdom, she speaks in what she'd call a 'resonant' voice, steeples her fingers, and stares at the supplicant from under her heavy brows.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Though essentially a con artist, Madame has bought enough into her own shtick that she remains open to the existence of spirits: and if a machine really could do what George claims? That would set her up for life, especially if she could convince George to allow her exclusive use of it. A use of Oral History in combination with specific questions gets Madame Isis to reveal the following:").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Ask the player whether or not Viv has lost someone in her own life. If so, Madame Isis senses 'a spirit floats about you, my dear, wishing to speak' (a guess on her part, but she's a great cold-reader) and invites her to participate in a 'Communion with the Dead,' held nightly. Communions start at 8 p.m. and last around two hours — longer if the spirits feel especially communicative. Otherwise, she indicates that if Viv has any further questions, perhaps she'd like to attend a 'communion' tonight.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Viv's canny journalist's eye identifies several different types at the communion: an older widow, a bereaved parent, an idly curious spectator, and a handful of obvious regulars who acknowledge each other before taking their seats. Cloyingly sweet incense fills the room from several braziers. Madame Isis begins the service by reading passages from the Book of the Dead. Some in the audience mutter, 'Amen,' probably from force of habit.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Other than the reading, the séance consists of ordinary channeling. Should she have learned that Viv has lost someone, Madame passes on a 'message' telling Viv that this person has found peace in the afterlife but there's something they want Viv to do for them — but she can't make it out before losing the connection. 'Perhaps next time.' If Viv asks to contact the spirit of George Preston, Madame Isis stalls with some patter about not being able to sense George's spirit among them. Streetwise: Madame's reputation might survive channeling a living person to a few ordinary clients, but she never forgets Viv's profession and has no desire to end up on the wrong side of an exposé.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Should Viv decide to question any of the clients before or after the communion, she ends up talking to Addie Sims (alternate, 'Addie Needs Answers'). Otherwise, Madame Isis catches Viv's eye and nods her head significantly in Addie's direction just as Addie is on the verge of slipping out the door.").

She'll find the body at the official mortuary for the medical examiner, located in Bellevue Hospital's (see p. 173) Pathological Building on East 29th Street. The crowd of over a hundred thousand outpatients that flows in and out of the hospital daily provides her with some anonymity, although it thins out near the morgue.").

O'Connor in 'What the Cops Know,' she may persuade him to pull some strings with the police coroner, Phil Lenz, for her to get in and see the body. If not, she'll need to come at night and break into the morgue's vault. Provided she passes a Stealth Quick Test to make it to the doors of the morgue, a simple use of the Locksmith ability lets Viv open the heavy metal doors.").
scene_text(the_thing_in_the_morgue, "Whether or not Lenz shows her the body, the scene follows a similar course. Viv must first walk through a room of sheet-covered wooden dissection tables and instruments to get to the mortuary's cold chamber. The mortuary handles the hospital's many dead, including victims of accidents and murder. During the day, medical students bend over a few corpses on the tables, bone saws, scalpels, and forceps in hand. At night, Viv moves through chilly silence and shadow.").
scene_text(the_thing_in_the_morgue, "Beyond the main dissection room, Viv comes to the vault where the bodies are stored. The building's subterranean stone construction provides a certain natural coolness which is augmented by a loud industrial refrigeration system, but they only do so much to hide the odor of death. Anyone who doesn't spend regular time down here initially chokes on the thick, sweet smell as they open the door. If present, Lenz offers Viv a scented handkerchief.").
scene_text(the_thing_in_the_morgue, "The shelves of the cold chamber make it resemble a grotesque bunk-house. Without Lenz's help, Viv takes a few minutes to locate the corpse. Using Evidence Collection to check ankles and toes for identification, she soon notes the bodies lie in a rough chronological order. Fink — what remains of him — rests in a top bunk. To get a good view of the body at night, Viv may pull up a small- but-sturdy stepladder which provides attendants adequate balance to move hundreds of pounds. During the day, Lenz calls in a single medical student to wrest Fink down.").
scene_text(the_thing_in_the_morgue, "By now, Fink's body has taken on the greenish- blue color of early decomposition. The coroner closed Fink's staring eyes, but his mouth continues to gape in horror. Round, purpling bruises score his torso and one arm. In the center of each bruise, Viv sees a puncture wound over a small, hard lump. Several lumps have been excised for analysis, leaving gouges. Below his torso? A bag holds in what intestines remain and below that — nothing. The ends of his flesh appear ragged, as if torn off with an act of extreme force.").
scene_text(the_thing_in_the_morgue, "Evidence Collection: Either through talking to Lenz or by reading the autopsy notes, Viv learns that Fink died of a 'massive coronary event.' In lay terms, his heart gave out. The bruising and mutila- tion to his body occurred immediately after death, leaving venom directly under the skin instead of filtering into his bloodstream. Give the player time to connect this venom to the puncture-marks Viv saw in the center of the bruises. The venom's composition doesn't match any known species, but it most closely resembles that of jellyfish. The autopsy notes include several photographs of the bruising. If visiting the morgue during the day, Viv may grab one on a Difficulty 4 Quick Filch Test.").

In this case, players holding 'Soft Spot' take a −2 to either of the following Challenges. Otherwise, it's one of the job-seekers she has seen massed outside Fuller's. Just then, a swirling mass of translucent tentacles moves in from the edge of the spotlight. She may choose to look away and examine the 'Body in the Chair' afterward; to watch and face the test 'Watching the Devourer;' or to burst in and interrupt, in which case the action skips to 'They Came from Beyond.' Examining the corpse after 'Watching the Devourer' does not trigger the 'Body in the Chair' test.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "The action is over in a matter of horrifying moments. A wise player would have Viv look away, in which case she hears squishing, snapping, and a muffled scream. If Viv keeps watching, she sees a writhing, iridescent mass of tentacles and claws swarm over the body, which lets out a muffled scream before being devoured. The tentacles wrap it tight, and pincers begin snipping off pieces of flesh and passing them into a dark maw, eventually devouring the flesh and organs, leaving parts of a skeleton with ragged ends of muscle and tissue hanging off. The body's clothes, neatly snipped by the pincers, lie on the floor at its feet. Once the beast ceases feeding, Viv can sense it looking for its next prey — at which point it suddenly vanishes.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "If Viv brought company, they pass out as Viv undergoes either of the next two tests. If Viv fails her run-ins with Fuller, she comes to with her companion tied up beside her. Otherwise, she can shake them back to a dazed consciousness and have them help her handle Fuller.").

scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "Whether he shouts it down from his darkened office with his hand on the switch that powers Preston's machine or mutters it while tied to the chair himself, Fuller can fill Viv in on the details of the situation. By now, she might be surprised to learn that he didn't kill George Preston, but he pushes the point, ignoring the collateral damage he has caused since.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "George Preston caused the first two deaths, Fink's and his own. The first was an accident. The light from Fink's room must have drawn the at- tention of the creature while it ignored Preston's lightless room. That night after work, with Charlie having slipped out, Preston broke down and con- fessed the whole thing to Fuller, begging the older man to destroy his device — but only after he let beasts from beyond kill him in the same way they had eaten Fink. To him, this seemed like the only way he could atone for Fink's death. Fuller didn't believe a word of it, instead thinking the kid had finally snapped from too many nights working late. Maybe he'd killed his neighbor, but nothing else made sense.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "Only after Fuller watched from his darkened office did he believe Preston's story. He threw the emergency switch to cut power to the kid's bench, but it was too late. Viv senses excitement, rather than horror in his voice. In Fuller's opinion Preston was a coward, afraid of his own success. If the world at the edge of our vision isn't made up of ghosts but of something much more horrible, that just makes his invention more valuable.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "All Fuller needs now are those damn schematics so he can reproduce the machine — as a weapon. With the news from Europe, he knows it'll be a seller's market soon enough and this could change things the way gas did in the Great War. And Charlie (if he killed or captured her)? He could tell it was only a matter of time before she went to the police — doesn't have the sense to keep her head down.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "The thing Viv saw? That isn't the only kind of beast out there, that's just his 'pet' — the one who's learned to come when Fuller switches on the device. He's seen far more than that: big, stupid, whale-like blobs and swarms of tiny creatures which pick over and devour the remains. You'd never know anyone had died. (Fuller isn't naïve about his 'pet.' He switches off the machine once it loses interest in a body, only switching it on a few minutes later to attract the scavengers who remove the corpse. If the 'pet' can see beyond the light, Fuller doesn't want to find out firsthand.)").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "Her head splitting, Viv comes back to full con- sciousness to find herself tied to a chair (with any companions beside her) on the main floor of the repair shop. Lights from the workbenches, meant to illuminate detail work, encircle her in a painful glare. She has difficulty making out any details be- hind the brightness. Once Fuller sees she's woken up, he monologues details from 'Fuller Fesses Up' above as he switches on the machine, triggering the test 'They Came from Beyond.'").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "Though Viv gets a chance to escape, the ma- chine begins to take effect, revealing sights and sounds from a plane of reality bordering on our own. It takes some time for the creature to realize Fuller has set out a second meal.

scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "After either rushing in to save the captive in the chair, or being captured by Fuller and making the Stability Challenge 'They Came from Beyond' (whether Advance or Setback), Viv may attempt to escape without being eaten. She may use Quick Tests (Advance 4+, but any failed test increases the Difficulty of the next Quick Test of any kind by 1) as proposed by the player. If tied up by Fuller, she can use Athletics to untie her hands or Preparedness to have a pocketknife Fuller didn't think to check for. A successful Quick Test of Athletics or Fleeing, if Fuller has spotted her, gets her into the darkness where she can pull the plug to the machine, flip the wall switch to the desk, smash the machine, shoot it (the canonical method of destruction), or even propose a way to switch on the light in Fuller's office, turning the creature's attention to him. If she fails the tests and the Difficulty gets too high? Move on to the coda and Viv's last thoughts.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "How Viv resolves the situation if she escapes the creatures depends entirely on the player and her goals. She may wish to hold Fuller at gunpoint, if she has a gun, and force him to confess to his crimes. She may knock him cold or shoot him in the legs, and leave him for the police. She may prefer to rely on her two dice in Fleeing and try to grab any schematics (appropriate on whatever the GM considers a high success) as she escapes, calling in a tip for MacAdams to check out the repair shop.").

He slammed and locked he door to his room, but it passed through the wall, almost as though it weren't made of real stuff. For a few minutes, he sat paralyzed on the bed, watching things like the blimp float or mosey by. Then, right before Fink screamed, he saw something else — like a soap bubble but with claws for arms and what looked like tentacles. He'd have screamed too, if he weren't too scared to breathe. Its hideous teeth opened — Fink screamed and it moved through the wall into Fink's room instead. A moment later, it vanished. Everything went back to normal.").

Though by trade an electrician, I consider myself an inventor in the tradition of Marconi, Morse, and Bell. For several years now, I have worked on a device, which I consider a successor to the radio and the television. Just as we walk daily through waves from a dozen radio stations and now television stations as well, so I believe we are constantly surrounded by the unseen spirits who exist at a frequency most humans cannot perceive. From my readings on psychic phenomena, I conclude that mediums are no different from others who possess such acute hearing that they cannot live in a house with others or such a strong sense of taste that they only eat the blandest of foods. And we average men are like the color-blind who cannot distinguish red from green, only our numbers are far greater. Machines, unlike men, face no such limitations. When complete, my device will amplify light and sound to make visible that which exists at the very edge of what you and I can see and hear. From your books, I gather that you possess a greater openness to scientific proof of psychic phenomena than many others in your line of work. I would be deeply indebted if you would be willing to discuss my theory with me further and attend the first public unveiling of the device, which I now believe to be in its final stages. I have recently begun attending psychic ceremonies at the Temple of Nephthys. From my observation, I believe the medium, Madame Isis, possesses a true connection to the spirit world. Unlike others whose séances I have attended, she does not elicit phantasmal raps, conjure glowing hands, or move objects with ghostly fingers as a magician might. Several of her regular attenders with whom I have spoken, including her secretary, attest to the veracity of statements they receive from the departed. I consider such testimonies better proof than showy phenomena. Despite my faith in my own observations, I hope I might ask whether you had visited her on one of your investigations and, if so, whether you observed any fraudulent behavior of the types you describe in your books. I remain yours sincerely, George Preston").
